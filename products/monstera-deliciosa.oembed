Its name comes from a Latin word meaning “abnormal” because of its unique, odd-looking, and perforated leaves that are often punched through with holes. This unique and vibrant houseplant is best for living and dining room spaces as it makes for a very interesting conversational piece.\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"ewa-rteLine\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cbr data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"ewa-rteLine\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eAbsolutely no hidden fees!
