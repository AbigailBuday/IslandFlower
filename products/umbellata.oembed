It’s a little different from its cousin, the Fiddle-Leaf Fig, but it grabs just as much attention and is a little easier to take care of. It's a very interesting houseplant for any collection – particularly if you like to collect from the Ficus or Fig family of large houseplants.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"ewa-rteLine\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"ewa-rteLine\"\u003eAbsolutely no hidden fees!
